        Don’t sell alcohol to people in remission to meet sales quotas, you’ll
        feel yuck!
        <br /><br /> Observe keyboards when crafting marketing narratives- “yoU”
        comes before “I” (it works best this way) <br />
        Care for clients before
        yourself so marketing won’t leave a sour aftertaste. <br /><br />
        IF MARKETING FEELS
        YUCK, YOU’RE DOING IT WRONG <br /><br />The aim is to land clients who NEED your
        service/product, not to land clients at any cost. Here’s a strategy 🏆
        <br /><br />
        SWITCH MARKETING THEMES from “here’s why you need me” to “here’s how I
        meet your needs” <br /><br />
        The former emphasizes their needs and CLAIMS you’re the
        solution; the latter suggests their needs are apparent to everyone and
        SHOWS you’re the solution. <br /><br />
        IS IT CLEAR THEY NEED YOU? <br /><br />
        Position as the
        viable option- Let them experience what it’d be like to have you or your
        product on their team; it’ll sway purchasing decisions in your favor.<br /><br />
        Your job is to make sure you’re positioned in their view and can back up
        your claims! <br /><br />AVOID DEMEANING CLIENT ACQUISITION PHASES <br /><br />If 25 clients are
        your target, land one and tailor your marketing campaign to their
        Likeness. When you land one, there’s another in the ethos. Find the
        second one, and you’ll see there are 10 more.<br /><br /> This perspective will make
        marketing easier ON you… Your conscience is clear; you’re making genuine
        money, your clients are having a transformative experience with your
        offerings… <br /><br />Doesn’t make marketing easier FOR you though.<br /><br /> This isn’t a
        “hack” … <br /><br />It’s just what you do to stop marketing from feeling YUCK.
