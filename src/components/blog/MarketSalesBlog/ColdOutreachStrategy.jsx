      Cold outreach is an art AI CAN’T help you with… <br />
      Your message is secondary! …finding where “ideal clients” nest determines the success rate of your 
      campaign. <br /><br />
      Ever been hunting? …you track a trail to find the pack. <br /><br />
      Birds of the same feathers flock together so find where they hang out before shooting. 
      Effective cold outreach is the same. You’re hunting for clients in a jungle marketplace; Identify one 
      and track their trail! <br /><br />
      Chances are they relate with like-minded people with similar challenges. 
      In every cluster of 10, at least 2 have mutual challenges. (Could be more) <br /><br />
      They’ve identified themselves for you, find their clusters, and your message will be welcomed like 
      music to a choir! <br /><br />
      This strategy is HOW TO HIT BIRDS IN A FLOCK. Throwing stones almost guarantees you hit AT 
      LEAST TWO… <br /><br />
      Don’t worry about the ability to throw at first, how’s your ability to track? 
      Focus on finding and speaking to the right flock. <br /><br />
      Just putting out messages into the abyss is a (hopeful) outreach campaign strategy… (Hope isn’t a 
      plan) <br /><br />
      Proper tracking unravels avatar patterns and behavioral frameworks that increase the potency of 
      your message as it’ll be landing on fertile soil! <br /><br />
      Learning what connects avatar networks also informs what offers you can make to turn “maybe” to “I 
      wish I’d met you sooner, how do I make a payment please?” <br /><br />
      One avatar’s network is a treasure trove of potential leads! …if our network is our net worth, their 
      network is your homework. <br /><br />
      It’ll be like hovering magnets over a toolbox of shiny objects; rest-assured metals will cling… 
      Follow spanners to sheds they lay- you might end up finding a car.<br /><br />
