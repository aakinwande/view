       Marketing isn’t presenting the full picture; it’s turning heads and hinting full picture! 
      Start observing the picture they form then affirm their imaginations with complimentary products, 
      brands, or services. <br /><br />
      It’s like Leonardo DiCaprio’s “inception”- Your goal is: <br /><br />
      MAKE THEM REACH CONCLUSIONS ON THEIR OWN 
      Otherwise, they feel cheated or coerced to purchase. 
      When #Apple sells iPhones (**with a million different capabilities) they market features not the whole 
      product.
      They create camera-quality ads and hint editing power. 
      When you purchase, you get the camera, speakers, screen resolution, processor speed, multitasking 
      capabilities, security features etc. <br /><br />
      In a market with high concern for Cyber security, guess which feature gets the higher ad budget. 
      …Listen to your audience. Deliver what their mind makes your product out to be. 
      You’re recording sales anyway! 
      Whether they’ve purchased to use one feature or all, YOU SOLD. 
      HERE’s THE KICKER <br />
      You’ve not used your iPhone for all it can deliver I can bet on that; Sometimes just finding out stuff it 
      can do justifies your purchase months down the line! <br />
      Let your brand/product be a gift that keeps on giving. <br />
      You DON’T have to say all you can deliver. Market one “best-seller” feature and when you reel them 
      in, JUST KEEP GIVING! <br /><br />
      1.Be a no-brainer deal (multi-dimensional utility) <br /><br />
      2.Observe the needs of your market/audience <br /><br />
      3.Market the aspect of your offer they seem to need <br /><br />
      4.Be the solution to that pressing need <br /><br />
      5.Keep unfolding your multi-dimensional utility in time <br /><br />
      That’s how you LAND AND RETAIN buyers.
