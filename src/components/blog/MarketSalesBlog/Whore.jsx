      If you have no use, you’re useless. Your value lies in the parts of yourself you commercialize; 
      Your mind, time, energy, or other (hopefully virtuous) elements of your being. 
      Make your offering note-worthy, and get great at marketing! 
      Deploy tools to compel attention and convince audiences… 
      intrigue, suspense, knowledge, humor, silence, shock, mystery, controversy, emotion, etc. 
      The ability to get people doing what they otherwise wouldn’t have (on their own) seen a need to, is 
      powerful. 
      Everyone uses marketing and sales techniques scripted or free flow- 
      To show one way better than another, distinguish and layout. 
      Convince and convey, illustrate, and portray, describe and direct, induce and seduce. 
      To compel and conduct, euphemize and gentrify ideas, package and deliver thought. 
      To make the inexplicable concrete, to show feelings. 
      To guide gently and suggest kindly, to nudge people drawing their own conclusions in directions 
      favoring you… 
      It’s the essence of clear communication, marketing, and sales. 
      You need these skills for social and business interaction. 
      Babies cry and look adorable to get parents’ attention, we’ve practiced since birth! 
      Sales & marketing teams need to know the psychology of persuasion, trends can only get you so far. 
      Coaches, leaders, Teachers, entrepreneurs, and preachers all need to have their marketing utensils 
      sharpened. 
      Whatever you’re selling, You need the ability to convince! 
      Audiences will need swaying- from potential life partners to customers to parliament. 
      Regardless of what part of yourself you commercialize to be of utility in life, getting good at 
      marketing has only upsides. "
