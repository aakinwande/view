We’re all whores; we just sell different parts of ourselves” -Thomas Shelby, OBE. <br /><br />
      If you have no use, you’re useless. Your value lies in the parts of yourself you commercialize; 
      Your mind, time, energy, or other (hopefully virtuous) elements of your being. 
      Make your offering note-worthy, and get great at marketing! <br /><br />
      Deploy tools to compel attention and convince audiences… 
      intrigue, suspense, knowledge, humor, silence, shock, mystery, controversy, emotion, etc. <br /><br />
      The ability to get people doing what they otherwise wouldn’t have (on their own) seen a need to, is 
      powerful. <br /><br />
      Everyone uses marketing and sales techniques scripted or free flow- <br />
      To show one way better than another, distinguish and layout. <br />
      Convince and convey, illustrate, and portray, describe and direct, induce and seduce. <br />
      To compel and conduct, euphemize and gentrify ideas, package and deliver thought. <br />
      To make the inexplicable concrete, to show feelings. <br />
      To guide gently and suggest kindly, to nudge people drawing their own conclusions in directions 
      favoring you… <br /><br />
      It’s the essence of clear communication, marketing, and sales. <br /><br />
      You need these skills for social and business interaction. 
      Babies cry and look adorable to get parents’ attention, we’ve practiced since birth! <br /><br />
      Sales & marketing teams need to know the psychology of persuasion, trends can only get you so far. 
      Coaches, leaders, Teachers, entrepreneurs, and preachers all need to have their marketing utensils 
      sharpened. <br /><br />
      Whatever you’re selling, You need the ability to convince! 
      Audiences will need swaying- from potential life partners to customers to parliament. 
      Regardless of what part of yourself you commercialize to be of utility in life, getting good at 
      marketing has only upsides.
