        You can earn $96k, $36k or $144k annually, depending on the month as a
        solopreneur. Content presented like that embodies the essence of
        copywriting, marketing, and sales. <br />
        <br />
        Its packaging predicated on truth to pique interests… <br />
        <br />
        I’ve just said “Some months, a solopreneur may earn $8k, in other
        months- $3k, and in others- $12k” You can say “I’ve been a pilot for 20
        years” or “I’ve flown commercial jets for over two decades” The latter
        packs more gravitas! <br />
        <br />
        This representation strategy is effective in pitches, book marketing,
        ads, delivering reports to investors, etc. <br />
        <br />
        Speak the truth and deliver a Bentley in what looks like a yacht. Goes
        without saying- you must have the Bentley! …You must have the substance!
        …Or at least be convinced you do <br />
        <br />
        When marketing, articulate, formulate, and present:
        <br />
        1.Ensuring you take nothing away from your impeccable substance; <br />
        <br />
        2.Ensuring your substance is represented by a status it may yet become.{" "}
        <br />
        <br />
        You lose currency of PERCEIVED VALUE if you cannot market the right way
        even when you’re crème de la crème…
