        Give so much value they feel criminal not paying your worth! <br />
        No good deed goes unpunished these days… <br />
        <br />
        If they turn a blind eye (keen to exploit you) Laud your efforts so they
        salute the diamond in their rough. <br />
        Great work shouldn’t be rewarded by compliments alone …Agree? Or Nah{" "}
        <br />
        <br />
        Ensure your value to clients compounds over time so you compel great
        pay. Be a multi-dimensional utility and highlight your value if your
        efforts go maliciously unacknowledged. <br />
        <br />
        The commitment to deliver so much value it chills their spine can
        backfire if that client is just sinister; But keep dishing out value the
        world can verify as excellent… <br />
        <br />
        That way you stand on solid ground when you demand better. As a service
        provider, you can earn life-long relationships more valuable than
        Bitcoin but for survival's sake secure your coins along the way!
