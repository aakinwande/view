      “Niching-down” is trumpeted for good reason; 
      But don’t overly simplify your offer untill your prospect market resembles endangered species… 
      Target a market with flourishing numbers. Offer solutions to their mutual needs. 
      Especially as you’re trying to build traction… 
      You’ll hardly uncover all you can offer stomping unto the scene laser-niched down without 
      exploration. 
      The flip-side is you can bill more if your prospective market has exclusivity like endangered species… 
      BUT 
      Starting out, you wouldn’t have amassed the liver nor value proposition to command premium pay."
