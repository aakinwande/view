        Here’s how I overcame imposter syndrome!! <br />
        When I tell people I’m a writer, deep down, I understand that writing
        can be done by anybody. (***let’s face it, these are words we speak that
        are just strung together and somehow, we can attach monetary value to a
        body of work) <br />
        <br />
        I asked myself where exactly the value for my work lays. And for me it’s
        in THOUGHT AND TRUTH …Stay with me here, you don’t want to miss this!{" "}
        <br />
        <br />
        I’ve sold some bodies of work for say USD$2000 and someone else had seen
        it prior, who wouldn’t value it for a slice of pizza. (their loss!){" "}
        <br />
        <br />
        But how do I reconcile the debate within my mind on if my work is worth
        any money? <br />
        <br />
        I ask myself: “To the best of your ABILITY TO THINK did you speak the
        whole TRUTH?” <br />
        <br />
        I understand I’m primarily paid to think, and that’s the difference
        between writers- their inclinations and schools of thought! (I’ll even
        debate this) <br />
        <br />
        I’ve written about how two persons can have the same experience with
        varying outcomes, and it’s the same here as we can consume the same
        research content and distill the information differently… <br />
        <br />
        Every writer is inclined in a certain way and when a client likes the
        way I’m inclined to think, that’s what they pay me for! <br />
        <br />
        …HERE’s THE GOOD PART <br />
        <br />
        I don’t serve everybody, …I can’t! I can only serve those in tandem with
        how my brain mechanism analyses and dishes out content; …from
        copywriting projects to ghostwriting projects. <br />
        <br />
        Understanding that the uniqueness of my thought-trains as an individual
        is valuable not just for their originality, but for the proven net
        positives they have on my clients’ operations and needs makes me
        confident enough to call myself a writer and receive pay without feeling
        an imposter
