        Don’t niche away your profit! <br />
        “Niching-down” is trumpeted for good reason; <br />
        But don’t overly simplify your offer untill your prospect market
        resembles endangered species… <br />
        <br />
        Target a market with flourishing numbers. Offer solutions to their
        mutual needs. <br />
        Especially as you’re trying to build traction… <br />
        You’ll hardly uncover all you can offer stomping unto the scene
        laser-niched down without exploration. <br />
        <br />
        The flip-side is you can bill more if your prospective market has
        exclusivity like endangered species… <br />
        <br />
        BUT <br />
        <br />
        Starting out, you wouldn’t have amassed the liver nor value proposition
        to command premium pay."

        You’ve got one shot- don’t target 2 birds on a wire. Go to the park,
        target the flock of birds group feeding. <br />
        You dramatically increase your probability of hitting one <br />
        <br />
        Do so couple more times to uncover the “best” offer THEN niche-down.{" "}
        <br />
        <br />
        THE BEST OFFER is one that exercises your strengths, tackles a unique
        pain point for clients, and makes your bank app your favorite to open.{" "}

        Don’t niche away your profit!
