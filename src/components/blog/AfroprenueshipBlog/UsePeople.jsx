        Earn a living using other people’s talent! <br /><br />
      You’ve heard OPM (other people’s money) echoed in the investing world… 
      OPT (other people’s talent) is perhaps not echoed as fervently but celebrated nonetheless. <br /><br />
      You can pay talented people to get jobs done for you or give them tools to deliver the best for 
      others… <br />
      Either way you’re reaping benefits off talent absent from your toolkit. <br /><br />
      Find talented people to partner with, don’t waste time learning what they’re perfecting. 
      Someone’s lurking who will if you don’t- making their own team formidable! <br /><br />
      Elite businesses understand the OPT concept hence all the rave about attracting and retaining top 
      talent… <br />
      They’ll pay what they command and reap exponential benefits over time in return. <br /><br />
      It’s why sports teams trade players and tech giants juggle the same people. If Apple showed interest, 
      Alphabet would love to have them. <br />
      They know top talent is the crux of the matter. <br /><br />
      Losing an investment opportunity isn’t as regret-inducing as Losing top talent. 
      Assisting their upward trajectory earns you an asset that’ll keep yielding rewards (monetary and 
      otherwise) <br /><br />
      Efficient partnerships are predicated on each party being of recognizable utility, not 50/50 input 
      splits <br /><br />
      If you can’t do it, fund those who can; you’ll earn from skills you don’t have. 
      This approximates every partnership on the face of the planet. <br /><br />
      With all the generic #AI content out now, talented ghostwriters will become more expensive to hire… 
      (If you need original content that is) <br /><br />
      We’re at the advent of an era where thinkers, writers, creators, etc. will have increasing value as the 
      talent pool seemingly shrinks and computer-generated content floods your feed. <br /><br />
      FIND TOP TALENT NOW. <br /><br />
      Partner to optimize their workflow or start building a relationship that’ll afford you concessions when 
      you need to work with them. <br /><br />
      They’ve invested time and acquired the skill; Swoop in! invest your resources and reap the benefits! 
      Now’s the time to earn from people’s Talent by empowering them or using them.
