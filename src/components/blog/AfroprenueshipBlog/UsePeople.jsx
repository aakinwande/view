      You’ve heard OPM (other people’s money) echoed in the investing world… 
      OPT (other people’s talent) is perhaps not echoed as fervently but celebrated nonetheless. 
      You can pay talented people to get jobs done for you or give them tools to deliver the best for 
      others… 
      Either way you’re reaping benefits off talent absent from your toolkit. 
      Find talented people to partner with, don’t waste time learning what they’re perfecting. 
      Someone’s lurking who will if you don’t- making their own team formidable! 
      Elite businesses understand the OPT concept hence all the rave about attracting and retaining top 
      talent… 
      They’ll pay what they command and reap exponential benefits over time in return. 
      It’s why sports teams trade players and tech giants juggle the same people. If Apple showed interest, 
      Alphabet would love to have them. 
      They know top talent is the crux of the matter. 
      Losing an investment opportunity isn’t as regret-inducing as Losing top talent. 
      Assisting their upward trajectory earns you an asset that’ll keep yielding rewards (monetary and 
      otherwise) 
      Efficient partnerships are predicated on each party being of recognizable utility, not 50/50 input 
      splits 
      If you can’t do it, fund those who can; you’ll earn from skills you don’t have. 
      This approximates every partnership on the face of the planet. 
      With all the generic #AI content out now, talented ghostwriters will become more expensive to hire… 
      (If you need original content that is) 
      We’re at the advent of an era where thinkers, writers, creators, etc. will have increasing value as the 
      talent pool seemingly shrinks and computer-generated content floods your feed. 
      FIND TOP TALENT NOW. 
      Partner to optimize their workflow or start building a relationship that’ll afford you concessions when 
      you need to work with them. 
      They’ve invested time and acquired the skill; Swoop in! invest your resources and reap the benefits! 
      Now’s the time to earn from people’s Talent by empowering them or using them."
