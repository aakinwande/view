        CHATGPT GAVE SHALLOW ADVICE WHEN ASKED “HOW TO COLD OUTREACH” …LISTEN
        UP! Show potential clients what you’ll do for them they don’t want to
        hear it.<br /><br /> HERE’S COLD OUTREACH SCRIPTS FOR LINKEDIN: “Hey (their name),
        I’ve studied the content you’ve been putting out to promote your (X)
        here’s 10 original posts I’ve created in your brand’s voice that’ll
        speak to your high-ticket customers I’ll appreciate your thoughts on
        them and please feel free to use them if you’d like” HERE’s ANOTHER:
        “Hey (their name), I’ve seen your (X) product and I’ve created these (X)
        to supercharge your marketing campaign… I’d love to get your thoughts
        and here’s a 2-page pdf spelling out more sales conversion ideas you
        should be implementing. 
        <br /><br />We can easily refine them with a brief
        conversation if we need to or you can just roll with them Let me know…”
        Both texts compel responses using the same subtle sales technique.
        They’ll bear different fruits… PAY ATTENTION TO THIS <br />
        <br />
        1.Your prospect deems you a “forward thinker” and an “initiative taker”
        …you’ve done the work to study and deliver heat! <br />
        <br />
        2.You’re willing to give value free which does two things for you-{" "}
        <br />
        A. If you’ve done due diligence and deliver something incredibly useful,
        they could be inclined to pay you for the work <br />
        B. They may think “huh, if all this fire is free, the premium version
        must be something to behold” …you’ve made an impression! <br /><br />
        3.You’ll induce a response (HIGH PROBABILITY) Everyone loves a “no
        obligation” gift. That’s what you’re giving. They can utilize your
        solution with zero burden. (Good enough to at least say thanks to you){" "}
        <br />
        <br />
        4.When people put out marketing content, they crave feedback. You’ve not
        only given feedback you’re giving solutions that make their efforts more
        productive <br />
        <br />
        5.In the second script you’re making yourself part of their team saying
        “WE” …like their problem is yours. They’ll likely want to schedule that
        call. <br />
        <br />
        I’ve landed clients this way and gotten ignored but my batting average
        indicates I’ve won with this strategy way more. <br />
        <br />
        STOP knocking on doors, start kicking them in! Show what you’ll do for
        them, stop pitching “what’s possible” Your success-rate-determinant here
        is how potent the solution you deliver is. Posts, videos, Email funnel,
        Ideas etc. GIVE YOUR BEST
