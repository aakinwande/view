        Experiencing an energy awakens it’s likeness within you. 
        “Iron sharpeneth iron” “Show your friends I’ll tell who you are” “Birds of same feather flock together” 
        The fact is- Like calls unto like, deep unto deep. 
        Listen to confident people speak people will say you’re confident as all you’ll know to be is that. 
        Just like computers- (garbage-in garbage-out) what you ingest you’ll digest and project. 
        That’s why they say “read a lot” because you’ll speak only knowledge! …that’s literally all you’ll have 
        to give! 
        Practice makes improvement! Keep ingesting all you want to be. 
        Curate your content diet you’ll create the reality you previously thought could only be imagined. 
        Surround your conscious mind with indicators of what you want, your subconscious will deliver HOW 
        to produce them."
