        A life worth talking about must first be lived. <br />
        Quality stories are never risk-averse tales. <br /><br />
        It’s true for legends! All the greats referenced today- the Rosa Parks, Martin Luthers and Mandelas…. 
        Their lives can’t be described as walking on paved paths!<br /><br /> 
        Adversity shaped meaning and the voluntary adoption of responsibility yielded a life worth 
        referencing. <br /><br />
        Don’t just be tall when your counterparts are short. Stand and focus on getting taller 
        Strategize for growth, not their downfall. <br /><br />
        Sometimes you’re only in competition with the thoughts you believe others are having- Free 
        yourself! <br /><br />
        …You’re doomed to your own autonomy, embrace it. <br /><br />
        We exist for experiences and expression; <br />
        Express yourself purposefully let others experience the best of humanity through you
