        Quality stories are never risk-averse tales. 
        It’s true for legends! All the greats referenced today- the Rosa Parks, Martin Luthers and Mandelas…. 
        Their lives can’t be described as walking on paved paths! 
        Adversity shaped meaning and the voluntary adoption of responsibility yielded a life worth 
        referencing. 
        Don’t just be tall when your counterparts are short. Stand and focus on getting taller 
        Strategize for growth, not their downfall. 
        Sometimes you’re only in competition with the thoughts you believe others are having- Free 
        yourself! 
        …You’re doomed to your own autonomy, embrace it. 
        We exist for experiences and expression; 
        Express yourself purposefully let others experience the best of humanity through you "
