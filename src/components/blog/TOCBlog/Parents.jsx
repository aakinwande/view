        desc="Light serves to expose or direct, depending on context and situation. 
        light coming into a situation can mean clarity and direction and in other situations, light thrown in 
        will mean uncovering that which was previously hidden. 
        The same multi-meaning can be read into a range of concepts and the most intriguing examples can 
        be found all over the human experience. 
        People can interpret gifts as a show of condescension and an attempt at belittling their person. 
        There’s a parable that tells a story of someone jumping in front of a bullet in an attempt to save 
        another’s life, only for the saved to turn round and complain that the savior’s blood has stained their 
        white shirt. 
        UNDERSTAND THIS: 
        An object’s perception affects their reception. 
        What that means is what you’re giving may not be what is being received. 
        When you shed light on someone’s path, you may do so with the intention of guiding them and 
        illuminating their journey but what you might have unintentionally done is brought their doom trail 
        to light literally. 
        You might have sent them spiraling into depression because with that light comes the reality that 
        they’re headed toward destruction. 
        You mean well but on the receiving end, it’s perceived differently. 
        How do you bridge the gap to ensure everyone is on the same page? 
        Have you ever wondered why children think parents hate them when parents discipline them? 
        Parents only hope to correct a destructive habit but the kids receive a message of hatred. 
        The correction is rooted in love but both parties are essentially communicating with different 
        languages. 
        If we communicate intentions clearly, maybe there’ll be more embrace of good deeds as what they 
        are. 
        Maybe if we let people know what it takes to gift them, they’ll appreciate it more. Or maybe we 
        should gift only to the limit of the receiver’s level of understanding. 
        If I bought a vehicle for a 2yr old, they certainly wouldn’t appreciate it as much as onlookers who 
        frequent public transport systems… 
        When you shed light, try, and explain that you mean to direct, not to expose. Unless that is indeed 
        your intention. 
        Always make sure you’re speaking the same language"
