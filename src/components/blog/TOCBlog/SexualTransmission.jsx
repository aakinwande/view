        Driving to the gym to run treadmills feels a bit odd knowing I could’ve
        run to the gym and back home as a full work-out session 😅 Here are some
        HUSH HUSH 🤫 motivations for remaining a gym member-<br />
        <br /> 1. Sexual
        transmutation! …Yeah. Observing and channeling good energy from
        “attractive” people inspires productive work-out sessions - Like when
        your crush comes to watch your game, and suddenly you display pro-level
        skill for 90 minutes straight 😂 <br />
        <br />
        2. Healthy competition! Call it
        camaraderie or any other positive term, but witnessing my friend run the
        treadmill for 60 minutes straight before lifting some mighty kilograms
        makes me want to at least attempt the same feat or push the envelope, so
        I can flex on him for a mutual laugh. 😂<br /> 
        <br />3. Belonging to a tribe! We all
        crave this. That’s why remote workers who agitated for the liberty to
        work from “home” still step out to “work” from coffee shops and
        co-working spaces sometimes. Working out for 30 minutes straight seems a
        short while with your tribe gingering you, but you may struggle to
        complete 15-minute sessions alone. Even lone wolves can achieve more
        with a tribe… I support wellness, fitness, health, and wholeness.
        Whatever motivates your discipline and commitment to good health,
        whether you exercise at the gym or do the work from home; kudos!
