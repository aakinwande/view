        3rd April 2023 -Thoughts I meditated on at 12:07 AM <br /><br />
        1. LIMITED MINDSET resembles CONTENTMENT, check yourself.<br /><br />


        
        2. Fine line between GREED and UNDERVALUING your service; How should you walk that line to 
        avoid falling on either end of the spectrum. <br /><br />
        3. People will say you’re SPINELESS but if you eventually avoid catastrophe having run away earlier, 
        they’ll say you’re PERCEPTIVE. <br /><br />
        4. Dream big! If you don’t make it they’ll say you’re DELUSIONAL but if you do they’ll call you 
        GENIUS. 
        …Fair game <br /><br />
        5. There’ll always be commentators in and around your life, DON’T be one. <br /><br />
        6. Advice will come from loved ones stemming from the purest place in their hearts about what they 
        believe is best for you. <br /><br />
        Going against the grain is considered truant and dismissive but if your route works out, you’re 
        considered independent and a born leader. <br /><br />
        7. You will be wrong many times when you take charge of your life but the alternative is to be wrong 
        many times because another person is in control of your life. <br /><br />
        8. Will you CREATE an imperfect yet fulfilling life and take responsibility for wins and losses or 
        BURDEN people who have their lives to live with the task of curating yours too. <br /><br /> 
        9. Spending life COMPLAINING leads to jagged self-worth and quiet desperation; 
        Embracing RESPONSIBILITY despite difficulties leads to impervious liberty of mind and fortitude of 
        spirit even in imperfect conditions and outcomes. <br /><br />
        10. Am I crazy, I should be ASLEEP. <br /><br />
        What crossed your mind the last time you meditated?
